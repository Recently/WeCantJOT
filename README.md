Currently a work in progress, not working yet.  Some errors with being able to check just the chat box, marking things, etc... but we're getting there.

  /docs/ is where github pages hosted, which you can access here: https://recently.github.io/WeCantJOT/   

To build your own,

npm install --save-dev typescript ts-loader webpack webpack-cli copy-webpack-plugin html-webpack-plugin css-loader style-loader alt1

npm run build 
upload the /docs/ folder to your host and access from alt1 browser.
